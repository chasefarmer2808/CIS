For this assignment, I choose do structure the message that gets sent as the
concatination of the IV, HMAC, and ciphertext.  The diagram below shows how the
message is structured.

| IV | HMAC | ciphertext |


The IV is 16 bytes, and will be the first 16 bytes of the message.  The HMAC will
be the next 20 bytes.  Finally, the ciphertext is the only thing of variable length,
so I put it at the end so we can just get the rest from the end of HMAC on.
Unpacking of the full message is done by splicing it on these boundaries.

For padding, I knew that I padding with a hex value that represented the pad size
would not work in all cases, because it would be hard to tell if the last byte
is part of the message or pad.  So instead, I padded with null characters, starting
with 0x08, which represents backspace.  That way, unpadding is achieved by simply
decrementing a pointer from the end of the message, until the 0x08 is reached.
Because 0x08 is backspace, there should be no chance a user is able to make it
the last character of the message by typing on their keyboard.
